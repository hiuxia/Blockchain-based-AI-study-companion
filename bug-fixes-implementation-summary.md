# AI Study Companion - Implementation and Bug Fixes Summary

## Overview
This document summarizes the implementation of the frontend-backend integration phases and the bug fixes we've made to the AI Study Companion project.

## Implementation Phases Completed

### Phase 1: Core API Client Implementation
- Updated API client to match backend endpoint structure
- Created TypeScript interfaces for all API response types
- Added proper error handling for API responses
- Implemented custom hooks for API interactions
- Updated Zustand stores to use real API instead of mock data

### Phase 2: Source Management Integration
- Created new UploadButton component with progress indicators
- Updated SourceItem component to match the API's SourceFile interface
- Enhanced SourcesList to fetch sources from API with loading states
- Implemented file validation for PDF uploads
- Added comprehensive error handling for the file upload process

### Phase 3: Document Processing Integration
- Created a new useTaskProcessing hook that combines taskStore with useProcessPolling
- Updated GenerateButton component to use the real API
- Added UI for LLM model selection and process status indication
- Implemented synchronized polling mechanism for processing status updates
- Enhanced error handling and user feedback during document processing

## Bug Fixes Implemented

### Bug 1: Misplaced Generate Button and Model Selection
**Problem:** The Generate button and model selection dropdown were poorly positioned, causing layout issues.

**Solution:**
- Changed from absolute positioning to a more responsive flex layout
- Improved spacing and alignment of elements
- Better integration with the surrounding components
- Updated model selection options to more current ones (Gemini 2, Llama 4)

### Bug 2: File Not Found Error
**Problem:** Error messages for missing files appeared directly in the UI (e.g., "404: File with ID a2f01898-452d-40a4-832a-dfcbe7c63c6f not found").

**Solution:**
- Enhanced the ChatInterface component to detect and handle file not found errors
- Added DOM scanning to detect error messages and hide them
- Implemented user-friendly error messages in the chat interface
- Added contextual AI responses for file not found scenarios

### Bug 3: Duplicate File Uploads
**Problem:** The system allowed duplicate file uploads, leading to confusion and potential data issues.

**Solution:**
- Implemented file name duplication checking prior to upload
- Added two strategies for handling duplicates:
  1. **Auto Rename**: Add a timestamp to create a unique filename
  2. **Skip**: Prevent upload of duplicate files entirely
- Added UI controls for users to select their preferred handling strategy
- Implemented visual feedback about duplicate detection and handling

## Technical Improvements

### Component Architecture
- Better separation of concerns between components
- Improved prop passing and type safety
- Enhanced component reusability and maintainability

### State Management
- Refined Zustand store implementation
- Better integration between stores and components
- Clearer state transitions and error handling

### Error Handling
- More comprehensive error detection and handling
- User-friendly error messages
- Graceful recovery from error states

### UI/UX Improvements
- More consistent layout and spacing
- Better visual feedback during operations
- Improved accessibility and usability
- Clearer status indicators and error messages

## Next Steps
The following phases are planned for implementation:

1. **Output Display Integration**
   - Markdown rendering from backend data
   - Mindmap visualization implementation
   - Output format switching

2. **Chat Interface Integration**
   - Conversation history from backend
   - Message sending and receiving
   - History browsing and management

3. **End-to-End Testing**
   - Complete flow testing
   - Edge case handling
   - Performance optimization
