Added file renaming endpoint via PATCH /sources/{source_id}
Summary/Mindmap Management:
Added name field to the DBSummary model
Updated SummaryResponse schema to include the name field
Created SummaryUpdate schema for the name update operation
Implemented summary API endpoints:
GET /summaries: List all summaries, with option to filter by named only

Great! We've successfully implemented the Frontend Layout Overhaul as described in Phase 1, Step 2 of the implementation plan. Here's a summary of the changes we made:
Updated the uiStore in src/lib/store/uiStore.ts:
Added state for tracking the active center panel tab
Added state for tracking the collapsed/expanded state of both sidebars
Added actions to toggle the sidebars and change the active tab
Created a new SavedItemsStore in src/lib/store/savedItemsStore.ts:
Implemented state for notes and summaries
Added CRUD operations for both notes and summaries
Added loading and error states
Created the CenterPanelTabs component in src/components/layout/CenterPanelTabs.tsx:
Implemented tab UI for switching between "Chat" and "Output" views
Used the uiStore to manage tab state
Modified the SourcesList component in src/components/sources/SourcesList.tsx:
Added a collapse/expand button
Implemented conditional rendering based on the collapsed state
Created the SavedItemsPanel component in src/components/layout/SavedItemsPanel.tsx:
Implemented a collapsible sidebar with internal tabs for "Notes" and "Summaries"
Added UI for viewing, renaming, and deleting saved items
Added functionality to load summaries into the Output view when clicked
Updated the main page layout in src/app/page.tsx:
Implemented the three-column layout with collapsible sidebars
Moved the GenerateButton above the Center Panel Tabs
Used the new components in the layout
These changes have completely restructured the frontend to match the planned layout overhaul. The application now has:
A collapsible left sidebar for Sources
A center panel with tabs for Chat and Output
A collapsible right sidebar for Saved Items (Notes and Summaries)
The Generate button positioned above the center panel
The layout is now more organized and user-friendly, with better space utilization through the collapsible sidebars.

  All the requested changes have been implemented:
ChatInterface.tsx:
Adapted to fit within the tabbed Center Panel structure
Now displays source selection status and integrates selected source IDs
Updates UI based on loading state and source selection
Provides visual feedback with loading indicators
ChatMessage.tsx:
Added a "Save" button that appears on hover for each message
Implemented a modal for getting a name for the note, content type, and optional source summary ID
Added visual feedback during the save process (loading spinner, success message)
Connects to the savedItemsStore to save the note
SavedItemsStore.ts:
Added a new createNote action to handle saving messages as notes
Integrated with the backend API via POST /notes endpoint
Updates the local state when a new note is created
Contextual Chat:
Ensured that chat messages include selected source IDs from sourceStore
Provides feedback about the number of selected sources
Encourages source selection when no sources are selected
These changes enhance the user experience by allowing seamless note-saving from chat messages and properly integrating the chat interface with the selected sources. The implementation follows modern UI patterns with proper loading states, error handling, and success feedback.

Added a "Save Summary" button that appears in the OutputPanel when a summary result is loaded (when summaryId is available in taskStore).
Created a dialog component that prompts the user to enter a name for the summary when the button is clicked.
Implemented the functionality to call the PATCH /summaries/{summary_id} endpoint with the provided name using the existing API client.
Added visual feedback for the user:
The button shows "Saving..." when in progress
A success message appears and fades out after saving
A helpful tooltip appears on hover over the button
The input field resets when the dialog is closed
Ensured the "Summaries" tab in the SavedItemsPanel updates by:
Making the renameSummary function update the local state
Refreshing the summaries list from the API after saving
The implementation follows the project's existing design patterns and integrates smoothly with the current codebase. The user experience is intuitive and provides appropriate feedback at each step.
