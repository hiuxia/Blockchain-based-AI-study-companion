I've successfully implemented the static UI components for the AI Study Companion application based on the provided design. Here's a summary of the main components created:

1. **Layout Components**:
   - `Header.tsx` - Top header with the application title
   - `MainLayout.tsx` - Main container for the application layout

2. **Sources Components**:
   - `SourceItem.tsx` - Individual PDF source item with checkbox
   - `SourcesList.tsx` - Left sidebar with list of PDF sources

3. **Chat Components**:
   - `ChatMessage.tsx` - Individual chat message component
   - `ChatInterface.tsx` - Middle section with chat messages and input

4. **Output Components**:
   - `OutputTabs.tsx` - Tabs for switching between Notes and Mindmap views
   - `NotesView.tsx` - Display area for notes content
   - `MindmapView.tsx` - Display area for mindmap visualization
   - `OutputPanel.tsx` - Right panel integrating tabs and views

5. **Additional Components**:
   - `GenerateButton.tsx` - Button for generating content from selected sources

All components follow the Next.js App Router conventions, use React functional components with TypeScript, and are styled exclusively with Tailwind CSS utility classes as required by the project standards. The implementation is currently static with placeholder data, focusing on the visual representation matching the provided UI design.

The components are organized in a logical directory structure within `frontend/src/components/` to maintain a clean separation of concerns and facilitate future development.
