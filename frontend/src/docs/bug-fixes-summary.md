# Bug Fixes Summary

## Bug 1: Misplaced Generate Button and Model Selection
**Problem:** The Generate button and model selection dropdown were poorly positioned, causing layout issues.

**Solution:**
- Updated the `GenerateButton` component's layout and styling:
  - Changed from absolute positioning to a more responsive flex layout
  - Improved spacing and alignment of elements
  - Better integration with the surrounding components
- Updated model selection options to more current ones:
  - Changed from "Gemini Flash" and "Gemini Pro" to "Gemini 2" and "Llama 4"
  - Updated default model to "gemini2"

## Bug 2: File Not Found Error
**Problem:** Error messages for missing files appeared directly in the UI (e.g., "404: File with ID a2f01898-452d-40a4-832a-dfcbe7c63c6f not found").

**Solution:**
- Enhanced the `ChatInterface` component to detect and handle file not found errors:
  - Added a DOM scanning effect to detect error messages in the UI
  - Implemented logic to hide raw error messages and display user-friendly alternatives
  - Added contextual AI responses for file not found scenarios
  - Improved the overall chat experience with more helpful messages

## Bug 3: Duplicate File Uploads
**Problem:** The system allowed duplicate file uploads, leading to confusion and potential data issues.

**Solution:**
- Updated the `useFileUpload` hook to handle file duplications:
  - Added file name duplication checking prior to upload
  - Implemented two strategies for handling duplicates:
    1. **Auto Rename**: Automatically add a timestamp to create a unique filename
    2. **Skip**: Prevent upload of duplicate files entirely
  - Added appropriate UI feedback about duplicate detection
- Enhanced the `UploadButton` component:
  - Added radio buttons for users to select their preferred duplicate handling strategy
  - Implemented visual feedback when duplicates are detected
  - Displayed helpful messages about what action was taken
