# Phase 3 Implementation Summary: Document Processing Integration

## Overview
This phase focused on integrating the document processing functionality with the real backend API. We implemented:

1. Integration of the process polling mechanism with the task store
2. A new combined hook that orchestrates polling and state management
3. Enhanced UI feedback during document processing
4. Proper error handling for all processing states

## Components Implemented/Updated

### 1. useTaskProcessing Hook (`frontend/src/hooks/useTaskProcessing.ts`)
- Created a new hook that combines the taskStore with the useProcessPolling hook
- Implements synchronized state between polling and task management
- Provides a unified interface for task processing
- Handles success and error callbacks properly

### 2. GenerateButton Component (`frontend/src/components/GenerateButton.tsx`)
- Updated to use the new useTaskProcessing hook
- Enhanced UI with a model selection dropdown
- Added processing status indicators and loading spinners
- Implemented improved error handling and user feedback
- Added support for different LLM models

### 3. TaskStore Updates (`frontend/src/lib/store/taskStore.ts`)
- Refined the task store implementation for better API integration
- Fixed error handling and polling mechanism
- Simplified the state management for processing tasks

## Implementation Details

### API Integration
The implementation now properly integrates with the following API endpoints:
- `POST /process` - To start processing selected source documents
- `GET /process/results/{task_id}` - To check the status of ongoing processing tasks

### Polling Mechanism
- Implemented a robust polling mechanism that checks task status at regular intervals
- Includes proper timeout handling and error recovery
- Synchronizes the polling state with the task store

### Error Handling
- Comprehensive error handling for all processing states
- Proper error messages for different failure scenarios
- Clean UI feedback for errors during processing

### Loading States
- Improved loading indicators for processing state
- Better visual feedback during document processing
- Clear indication of completed or failed processes

## Testing
To test this implementation:
1. Start the backend server
2. Start the frontend development server
3. Upload PDF files and select them in the sources list
4. Select an LLM model and click "Generate"
5. Observe the processing status updates
6. Verify that the process completes successfully or shows appropriate error messages

## Next Steps
The next phase should focus on Output Display Integration, which will implement:
- Update notes view to display real markdown results
- Implement mindmap visualization with real data
- Add support for switching between output formats
