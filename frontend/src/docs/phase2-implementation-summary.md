# Phase 2 Implementation Summary: Source Management Integration

## Overview
This phase focused on integrating the Source Management functionality with the real backend API. The implementation includes:

1. A new UploadButton component that handles file selection and upload
2. Updated SourceItem component to properly display source file data from the API
3. Enhanced SourcesList component that fetches data from the API and includes loading/error states
4. Integration with the source store and file upload hook

## Components Implemented/Updated

### 1. UploadButton Component (`frontend/src/components/sources/UploadButton.tsx`)
- Created a new component that uses the `useFileUpload` hook
- Implemented upload progress indicator
- Added error handling for file validation issues
- Integrated with the source store to update the list after successful upload

### 2. SourceItem Component (`frontend/src/components/sources/SourceItem.tsx`)
- Updated to match the SourceFile interface from the API
- Enhanced to display filename, content type, and creation date
- Added visual indicators for selected state
- Improved UI with better file type icons and formatting

### 3. SourcesList Component (`frontend/src/components/sources/SourcesList.tsx`)
- Added useEffect hook to fetch sources when the component mounts
- Implemented loading states with spinner animation
- Added error handling with retry functionality
- Integrated the new UploadButton component
- Enhanced the empty state message
- Updated to use the new SourceItem component interface

## Implementation Details

### API Integration
The implementation now properly integrates with the following API endpoints:
- `GET /sources` - To fetch the list of available sources
- `POST /sources` - To upload new PDF files

### Error Handling
The implementation includes comprehensive error handling for:
- Network errors during API calls
- File validation errors (wrong file type, size limits)
- Failed uploads
- Failed source fetching

### Loading States
The UI now properly shows loading states:
- During initial source list loading
- During file upload with progress indication

## Testing
To test this implementation:
1. Start the backend server
2. Start the frontend development server
3. Try uploading valid PDF files
4. Verify that files appear in the sources list
5. Test error cases:
   - Attempting to upload non-PDF files
   - Attempting to upload files larger than 50MB
   - Testing with network disconnected

## Next Steps
The next phase should focus on Document Processing Integration, which will implement:
- Process polling mechanism
- Task store integration with real API
- Generate button connection to real processing
