Last updated: 2023-07-17 15:30

## Phase 1: Setup and Preparation
Status: **COMPLETED**

### Steps 1-5 (Completed previously)
- âœ… Directory structure created (`sources/`, `data/`, `results/`, `common/`, `modified_backend/`)
- âœ… Source documents added to `sources/` 
- âœ… Test questions prepared in `data/test_questions.csv`
- âœ… Dependencies installed from `requirements_benchmark.txt`
- âœ… Environment configured with `.env` file containing `ARK_API_KEY`

### Steps 6-9 (Completed 2023-07-15)

#### 6. Backend Modifications
- âœ… 2023-07-15 14:15 - Modified `backend/app/api/qa.py`:
  - Added `contexts: List[str]` field to `QAResponse` model
  - Updated `ask_question` function to extract and return context chunks
  - Enhanced source reference extraction logic
  
- âœ… 2023-07-15 14:45 - Modified `backend/app/langchain_agent/tools.py`:
  - Made chunking configurable through environment variables (`CHUNK_SIZE`, `CHUNK_OVERLAP`)
  - Added validation for environment variable values
  - Enhanced metadata handling to track source documents

#### 7. Common Utilities
- âœ… 2023-07-15 15:00 - Created `backend/benchmark/common/api_client.py`:
  - Implemented `query_qa()` function for QA endpoint with latency tracking
  - Added `upload_source()` and `list_sources()` functions for managing test documents
  - Built robust error handling for API interactions

- âœ… 2023-07-15 15:30 - Created `backend/benchmark/common/utils.py`:
  - Implemented `load_test_data()` function with CSV validation
  - Added `initialize_deepseek_client()` function for DeepSeek API access
  - Created `find_backend_pid()` and `manage_backend_process()` for server management

#### 8. Judge Functions
- âœ… 2023-07-15 15:45 - Implemented DeepSeek judge functions in `utils.py`:
  - Added `judge_relevance_deepseek()` to evaluate answer relevance on a 1-5 scale
  - Implemented `judge_faithfulness_deepseek()` for fact-checking against provided contexts

#### 9. Completion Check
- âœ… 2023-07-15 16:00 - Implemented `check_completion()` in `utils.py`:
  - Added logic to determine if answers/refusals match ground truth
  - Returns detailed status information for correctness analysis

## Phase 2: Response Quality Evaluation
Status: **COMPLETED**

- âœ… 2023-07-16 15:30 - Created `test_response_quality.py` script:
  - Implemented prerequisite verification to check backend, API key, and test data
  - Added testing loop to process questions from `test_questions.csv`
  - Implemented result collection and evaluation via DeepSeek judge functions

- âœ… 2023-07-16 16:45 - Added comprehensive metrics calculation:
  - Task Completion Rate (TCR) and Refusal Accuracy (RA) calculation
  - Relevance and faithfulness score aggregation
  - Latency statistics (mean, median, p95, p99)
  
- âœ… 2023-07-16 17:30 - Implemented visualization capabilities:
  - Distribution plots for relevance scores 
  - Bar charts for completion status and question types
  - Latency distribution analysis

- âœ… 2023-07-16 18:00 - Added results persistence:
  - CSV export of detailed results for each question
  - Aggregate metrics summary
  - Visualizations saved as PNG files

- âœ… 2023-07-17 14:00 - Enhanced to support multiple models:
  - Updated to test both gemma3 and llama4 models
  - Added proper handling of OPENROUTER_API_KEY for llama4
  - Implemented model-specific result collection and comparison

- âœ… 2023-07-17 15:00 - Improved visualization capabilities:
  - Added comparative boxplots to show score distributions by model
  - Created heatmaps for question type performance across models
  - Added per-source document performance analysis
  - Implemented side-by-side metric comparisons with consistent color coding

## Phase 3: Chunking Strategy Evaluation
Status: **PENDING**

- ðŸ”„ Next steps: Implement `test_chunking_impact.py` script to:
  - Iterate through multiple chunking configurations
  - Manage backend restart between configurations
  - Monitor memory usage
  - Calculate metrics for each configuration

## Technical Notes

1. **DeepSeek API Integration**:
   - Successfully integrated with DeepSeek V3 using OpenAI-compatible client
   - The `.env` file is correctly loaded from the backend root directory
   - API key is stored in `ARK_API_KEY` environment variable

2. **Backend Communication**:
   - Modified backend to return context chunks along with generated answers
   - Implemented environment variable-based configuration for chunking parameters
   - Added robust error handling for API communications
   - Verified support for both llama4 (using OPENROUTER_API_KEY) and gemma3 models

3. **Result Processing**:
   - Implemented advanced metrics calculation with proper error handling
   - Added data visualization capabilities with matplotlib and seaborn
   - Designed flexible data storage for comprehensive analysis
   - Created comparative visualizations to showcase model differences

## Considerations

- The `ARK_API_KEY` environment variable is required for DeepSeek API access
- The `OPENROUTER_API_KEY` environment variable is needed for llama4 model testing
- Test questions should be validated before running full benchmark
- Backend modifications are non-intrusive and only exposed for testing purposes
