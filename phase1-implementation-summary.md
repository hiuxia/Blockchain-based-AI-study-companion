# Phase 1: Core API Client Implementation - Summary

## Implemented Components

### 1. API Client (frontend/src/lib/apiClient.ts)

- Updated the base URL to match the backend (`http://localhost:8000`)
- Implemented all endpoints according to the API documentation
- Created TypeScript interfaces for API response types:
  - SourceFile
  - ProcessTask
  - ProcessResult
  - ConversationHistory
- Enhanced error handling to properly parse API error responses
- Added special handling for FormData to allow the browser to set content type with boundary

### 2. Custom Hooks

#### File Upload Hook (frontend/src/hooks/useFileUpload.ts)

- Created a hook for uploading PDF files
- Implemented file validation (PDF only, size limit of 50MB)
- Added progress simulation since fetch doesn't provide native progress tracking
- Proper error handling and state management

#### Process Polling Hook (frontend/src/hooks/useProcessPolling.ts)

- Implemented a polling mechanism to check task status at regular intervals
- Configurable polling interval and maximum attempts
- Handles all task states: idle, polling, completed, failed
- Auto-starts polling when taskId is provided
- Cleanup on unmount to prevent memory leaks

#### Chat History Hook (frontend/src/hooks/useChatHistory.ts)

- Created a hook to fetch and save conversation history
- Implemented methods for retrieving all histories or a specific one
- Manages loading and error states

### 3. Updated Store Implementations

#### Source Store (frontend/src/lib/store/sourceStore.ts)

- Connected to the API client to fetch sources and upload new ones
- Added loading and error states
- Updated to use the real SourceFile type from the API

#### Task Store (frontend/src/lib/store/taskStore.ts)

- Implemented startProcessing method to trigger document processing via the API
- Added task status checking with the API
- Integrated polling logic to continuously check task status
- Enhanced state management to track polling status and results

## Next Steps

1. **Test API Integration**: 
   - Verify all API calls work correctly with the backend
   - Test error handling and edge cases

2. **Move to Phase 2**:
   - Implement the UploadButton component
   - Update the SourcesList component to fetch data on mount
   - Add loading indicators and error handling in UI components

3. **Future Considerations**:
   - Add unit tests for the hooks and stores
   - Consider adding JWT authentication if needed in the future
   - Implement caching strategies for frequently accessed data
