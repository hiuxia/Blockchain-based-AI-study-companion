# AI Study Companion Project Status

## Decisions Made
- Implemented a component-based structure for the frontend with clear separation of UI elements
- Used Zustand for state management split into three stores: sourceStore, taskStore, and uiStore
- Utilized TypeScript for type safety throughout the codebase
- Applied Tailwind CSS for styling, following utility-first approach
- Added "use client" directive to all client-side components for Next.js App Router compatibility
- Initial sources are pre-populated with placeholder data in the sourceStore
- Default activeOutputTab is set to 'notes' in the uiStore
- Default task status is set to 'idle' in the taskStore
- Used Mock Service Worker (MSW) for API mocking during development
- Implemented a comprehensive API client with proper typing and error handling
- Created mock handlers for all API endpoints defined in the API specification
- Updated API client to align with actual backend endpoints defined in API_DOC.md
- Implemented custom hooks for file upload, process polling, and chat history
- Updated Zustand stores to integrate with real backend API

## Action Items
- âœ… Phase 1: Implemented static UI components (completed)
  - Created layout components (Header, MainLayout)
  - Created source components (SourceItem, SourcesList)
  - Created chat components (ChatMessage, ChatInterface)
  - Created output components (OutputTabs, OutputPanel, NotesView, MindmapView)
  - Created auxiliary components (GenerateButton)
  
- âœ… Phase 2: Added interactivity and state management (completed)
  - Created Zustand stores (sourceStore, taskStore, uiStore)
  - Connected components to read from and update states
  - Added local state for chat input
  - Added "use client" directive to all client components

- âœ… Phase 3: Mock API implementation (completed)
  - Installed and configured Mock Service Worker (MSW)
  - Created mock handlers for all API endpoints
  - Implemented in-memory storage for mock data
  - Added simulated network delays and progressive task status updates
  - Created comprehensive API client in src/lib/apiClient.ts
  - Added proper error handling for all API requests
  - Documented mock API setup in src/mocks/README.md

- âœ… Phase 4: Core API Client Implementation (completed)
  - Updated API client to match the backend endpoint structure
  - Created TypeScript interfaces for all API response types
  - Implemented proper error handling for API responses
  - Created custom hooks for file uploads, process polling, and chat history
  - Updated Zustand stores to use real API instead of mock data

- âœ… Phase 5: Source Management Integration (completed)
  - Created new UploadButton component with progress indicators
  - Updated SourceItem component to match the API's SourceFile interface
  - Enhanced SourcesList to fetch sources from API and display loading/error states
  - Implemented file validation for PDF uploads
  - Added comprehensive error handling for the file upload process

- ðŸ”„ Future Phases:
  - Document processing integration
  - Output display integration
  - Chat interface integration
  - End-to-end testing of the complete flow

## Open Questions / Discussion Points
- Implementation details for actual PDF processing are not yet specified
- Chat message handling with backend is pending definition
- Mindmap visualization library or approach is not yet determined
- Error handling strategies for failed requests or processing
- Potential need for authentication or user management
- Optimization strategies for handling large PDFs or multiple sources
- Strategies for handling network failures and retry logic

## Deliverable/Milestone Updates
