# AI Study Companion Project Status

## Decisions Made
- Implemented a component-based structure for the frontend with clear separation of UI elements
- Used Zustand for state management split into three stores: sourceStore, taskStore, and uiStore
- Utilized TypeScript for type safety throughout the codebase
- Applied Tailwind CSS for styling, following utility-first approach
- Added "use client" directive to all client-side components for Next.js App Router compatibility
- Initial sources are pre-populated with placeholder data in the sourceStore
- Default activeOutputTab is set to 'notes' in the uiStore
- Default task status is set to 'idle' in the taskStore
- Used Mock Service Worker (MSW) for API mocking during development
- Implemented a comprehensive API client with proper typing and error handling
- Created mock handlers for all API endpoints defined in the API specification

## Action Items
- âœ… Phase 1: Implemented static UI components (completed)
  - Created layout components (Header, MainLayout)
  - Created source components (SourceItem, SourcesList)
  - Created chat components (ChatMessage, ChatInterface)
  - Created output components (OutputTabs, OutputPanel, NotesView, MindmapView)
  - Created auxiliary components (GenerateButton)
  
- âœ… Phase 2: Added interactivity and state management (completed)
  - Created Zustand stores (sourceStore, taskStore, uiStore)
  - Connected components to read from and update states
  - Added local state for chat input
  - Added "use client" directive to all client components

- âœ… Phase 3: Mock API implementation (completed)
  - Installed and configured Mock Service Worker (MSW)
  - Created mock handlers for all API endpoints
  - Implemented in-memory storage for mock data
  - Added simulated network delays and progressive task status updates
  - Created comprehensive API client in src/lib/apiClient.ts
  - Added proper error handling for all API requests
  - Documented mock API setup in src/mocks/README.md

- ðŸ”„ Future Phases:
  - Implement actual integration with real backend API
  - Add actual PDF processing functionality
  - Connect chat functionality to backend
  - Implement mindmap visualization rendering

## Open Questions / Discussion Points
- Implementation details for actual PDF processing are not yet specified
- Chat message handling with backend is pending definition
- Mindmap visualization library or approach is not yet determined
- File upload mechanism for PDF sources needs further specification
- Error handling strategies for failed requests or processing
- Potential need for authentication or user management
- Optimization strategies for handling large PDFs or multiple sources
- Strategy for transitioning from mock API to real backend

## Deliverable/Milestone Updates
1. Phase 1 (Static UI Implementation): **COMPLETED**
   - Successfully created all UI components according to design
   - Used Tailwind CSS for styling
   - Implemented proper component hierarchies and file organization
   
2. Phase 2 (State Management & Interactivity): **COMPLETED**
   - Implemented and connected three Zustand stores
   - Added client-side interactivity for all components
   - Updated components to reflect state changes
   - Fixed "use client" directive omissions

3. Phase 3 (Mock API Implementation): **COMPLETED**
   - Successfully implemented mock API service using MSW
   - Created handlers for all endpoints in the API specification
   - Implemented realistic simulation of asynchronous task progression
   - Built a comprehensive API client with proper typing and error handling
   - Added proper documentation for the mock API setup

4. Future Phases: **PENDING**
   - Real backend integration not yet started
   - PDF processing functionality not yet implemented
   - Additional features (e.g., advanced visualizations) pending
