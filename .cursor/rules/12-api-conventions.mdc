# API Conventions

- **Single Source of Truth:** The definitive API specification is maintained in `@./docs/api-documentation.md`. Refer *exclusively* to this document for endpoints, request/response schemas, and status codes. Do not rely on potentially outdated information.
- **Frontend Client:** Use the fetch wrapper provided in `frontend/src/lib/apiClient.ts` (or designated location) for all backend calls.
- **Error Handling:** Implement robust error handling for API calls on the frontend. Display user-friendly messages for failures.
- **Async Tasks:** Implement polling logic on the frontend to check the status of asynchronous tasks initiated via `POST /process`, as detailed in the API documentation (`@./docs/api-documentation.md`).
