# Project Overview: AI Study Companion

- **Goal:** Build an AI agent using LangChain/Gemini to process PDFs and generate structured Markdown output, which can be viewed as notes or visualized as a mindmap using Markmap. The application will also feature a chat interface for interacting with the processed content.
- **Core Context:** See the detailed principles and goals in `@./docs/project-principles.md`.
- **Tech Stack:** Refer to the definitive tech stack list in `@./docs/tech-stack.md`.
- **Backend API:** The backend API documentation is available at `@./.cursor/docs/API_DOC.md`. It defines the endpoints for file upload, document processing, and conversation history management.
- **Team Focus:** Currently focusing on frontend development (Next.js, TypeScript, Tailwind, Zustand) and backend (FastAPI) integration. Use the provided API documentation to ensure proper integration between frontend and backend components.
