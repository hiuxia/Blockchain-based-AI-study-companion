# Backend Development Standards

- **Core Conventions:** Adhere strictly to the standards outlined in `@./docs/backend-conventions.md`. This includes Python version, FastAPI patterns, SQLAlchemy usage, LangChain agent implementation details, error handling, and logging.
- **Formatting:** Use Black for code formatting. Ensure it's run before committing.
- **Type Hinting:** All Python code MUST include type hints for function arguments and return values.
